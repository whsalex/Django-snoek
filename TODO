Hackweek 6 Summary

We built up and implement the tool Snoek function areas during the
hackweek, which can be found at:

We focused on the main function parts in hackweek 6 duration, and we will
focus more in backend security, database validation, bug fix and function
improvement in the future.

FUTURE

        With the functions which a user can typical attend an activity to
        vote, view voting results and export the results to ODF document, we
        still got several features to be improved in the future:

        - function Part

                - Activity management to allow user create her own activity
                  without asking admin to do so

                        As we said in the requirement, any valid user is
                        allowed to create an activity containing any number of
                        Polls. However the activity creation model is not
                        finished in the hackweek.

                        Activity creator is allowed to remove/edit the
                        activities her owned in the front page. The previledge

                        the difference besides the Activity 'Hackweek T-shirt
                        registration'. But the button delt/edit is not
                        actually working atm.

                - Allow the activity deadline set to prcision of minutes

                - Allow user to regret a vote and re-vote

                - Allow user to remove own vote

                - Allow to search activities by creation date, deadline, etc.

                - Connect to Novell LDAP authentication and support user group

                - Password recall (send mail)

                - Support richer text area for activity descriptions/vote
                  questions

                        We got some links as required for voting questions, we
                        implement it by mixing html tags with questions data
                        set. The example canbe seen here:

                        http://147.2.207.135:8080/activity/4

                        A.

                        However, this is only a WORKAROUND since mixing html
                        tag with real data in a database is not really
                        acceptable solution.

                        So we will re-consider how to handle this. We did not
                        set this as a requirement spec in design phase. The
                        simplest way may be to add a 'details' field in the
                        table of database, in which html tag is allowed. With
                        that activity creater can put rich stuff like
                        hyperlinks, pictures etc. if she knows HTML.

                        B.

                        The workaround above is not working for
                        ODS(libreoffice) export, you can see the raw html will
                        be ugly exported as content with:

                        http://147.2.207.135:8080/download_activity/4

                        This would not be done before the point A is improved.

                - When edit an activity's question item, we should allow the
                  activity creater choosing to Remove related vote or NOT. The
                  current mechanism removed all of the questions forcely when
                  editing a question's content.

                - Based on the activity edit function, we should consider the
                  2-dimension table when a user doesn't vote for all of the
                  votes in an activity. We may will add a description of how
                  many users were not calculated in the 2-dimension table
                  because of the incomplete votes.

                - Vote in a specific range of users (individuals, groups)

                - Send spam mail to push user vote

        - UI

                - Front page category view of activity list

                - Front page paginate view of activity list

                - Display the total vote number in the activity display page

                - Display activity creation date/time in front page

                - Better UI with CSS design

                - bar chart of the statistics when reviewing voting results

                - Populate 'Who vote for what' table to odf file as well

KNOWN ISSUES:

        - The activity name cannot have '/', otherwise download odf will be failed

        - base1.html will cause severe performance issue in some firefox(3.6.6) as I noticed.
