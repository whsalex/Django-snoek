Latest summary
==============

We built up and implement the tool Snoek function areas during the
hackweek, which can be found at:

http://147.2.207.135:8080

We focused on the main function parts in hackweek 6 duration, and we will
focus more in backend security, database validation, bug fix and function
improvement in the future.

FUTURE

        With the functions which a user can typical attend an activity to
        vote, view voting results and export the results to ODF document, we
        still got several features to be improved in the future:

        - function Part

                - Support richer text area for activity descriptions/vote questions. Allow
                  add links to questions in activity creating phase.        

                - meeting room reservation implementation

                - allow Activities creater to create votes and questions as
                  many as they want (rather than fixed number of votes and
                  questions)
                  
                - Allow the activity deadline set to prcision of minutes

                - Allow to search activities by creation date, deadline, etc.

                - Connect to Novell LDAP authentication and support user group

                - Password recall (send mail)

                - Send spam mail to push user vote when an activity is about
                  to expired

                - When edit an activity's question item, we should allow the
                  activity creater choosing to Remove related vote or NOT. The
                  current mechanism removed all of the questions forcely when
                  editing a question's content.

                - Vote in a specific range of users (individuals, groups)

        - UI

                - Better UI with CSS design

                - Display activity creation date/time in front page

                - Front page category view of activity list

                - Front page paginate view of activity list

                - Display the total vote number in the activity display page

                - bar chart of the statistics when reviewing voting results

                - Populate 'Who vote for what' table to odf file as well

KNOWN ISSUES:

        - The activity name cannot have '/', otherwise download odf will be failed

        - base1.html will cause severe performance issue in some firefox(3.6.6) as I noticed.
