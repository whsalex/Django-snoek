Development Guide
=================

Get Code
--------

If you want to push the increnmental change of snoek, please send your public
ssh key to any of the contacts. You can retrieve the code by any of the
method:

    git clone http://147.2.207.136/repo/snoek.git
    git clone ssh://git@147.2.207.136/~/snoek.git

Prerequisite
------------

    * Python >= 2.6 (core python)

    * Django == 1.2.4 ( python module )

    * Odfpy == 0.9.2 ( python module )

    * celery == 2.5.3 ( python module )
    
    * django-celery == 2.5.5 ( python module )

    * kumbo == 2.1.8 ( python module )

    * A static http server (apache, lighttp, etc.)    

    *notice*

        it is highly suggested to use 'pip install' to install python modules.

Hosting static content
----------------------

2. Link the static content (css, image) to the root of your http server.

        snoek/$ sudo ln -s $(readlink -f ./media) $your_static_http_root

    The following is a substantial example of my development environment. My
    static http root is in /srv/www/htdoc

        $ find /srv/www/htdocs/ -maxdepth 1 -type l | xargs ls -l

        lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 32 2012-07-30 13:28 /srv/www/htdocs/media -> /home/yifan/project/snoek/media/

Create settings.py
------------------

    1) Make a Copy settings.py.sample

        snoek/$ cp settings.py.sample .

    2) To edit settings.py for your own testing environment, usually you only
    need to modify the MEDIA_URL value:

        MEDIA_URL = 'http://localhost/media/'

    make it point to your static server's root URL. This makes the css, image,
    jquery canbe imported to Snoek.

Create database
---------------

    It is fairly simple to start a new empty database in snoek:

        snoek/$ python manage.py syncdb

    * Notice: you will be asked to set a super user's password of the
      database.

    Meanwhile we also provide a sample database with test data populated for
    your experiments, to make use of it, simple make a copy:

        snoek/$ cp db.sqlite.sample db.sqlite

Run testing server
------------------

   snoek/$ python manage.py runserver celyryd # this is particularly for library module
   
   snoek/$ python manage.py runserver localhost:8080

Play snoek
----------

    1) Open you browser and visit the url:

        http://localhost:8080/admin

        Login with the super user you set in the Step 4 and try to create
        several users in the adminitration pages.

    2) Open you browser and visit the url:

        http://localhost:8080

        Normally you can play with Snoek now!

Patch submission process
------------------------

   - You did some nice work of code improvement

   - snoek/$ git commit -a -m 'your tips goes here'

   - snoek/$ git pull -r

   - snoek/$ git push

If you are interested but do not have a ssh permission, please send a
patch to any of the contacts via:

    [quote from libreoffice community]
    * create the patch file that you want to mail.  If you are in one
    repository you can use git directly to get e.g. the last change in your
    branch as a diff file with:

           git format-patch HEAD~1
