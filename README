Development Guide
=================

* If you want to push the increnmental change of snoek, please send your
public ssh key to any of the contacts.

0a. git clone ssh://git@147.2.207.136/~/snoek.git

[or]

0b. git clone http://147.2.207.136/repo/snoek.git

1. You need dependencies to run Snoek:

    - Python 2.6 +

    - Django for python

    - odfpy for python

    - A static http server (apache, lighttp, etc.)

    The Django and odfpy packs are put in the "dep" directory of the git repo.

2. Link the static content (css, image) to the root of your http server.

        snoek/$ sudo ln -s $(readlink -f ./templates/css) $your_static_http_root
        snoek/$ sudo ln -s $(readlink -f ./templates/image) $your_static_http_root
        snoek/$ sudo ln -s $(readlink -f ./templates/jquery) $your_static_http_root

    The following is a substantial example of my development
    environment. My static http root is in /srv/www/htdoc

        $ find /srv/www/htdocs/ -maxdepth 1 -type l | xargs ls -l
        lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 40 2011-09-26 10:58 /srv/www/htdocs/css -> /home/yifan/project/snoek/templates/css/
        lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 41 2011-09-26 10:45 /srv/www/htdocs/image -> /home/yifan/project/snoek/templates/image
        lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 43 2011-09-29 18:16 /srv/www/htdocs/jquery -> /home/yifan/project/snoek/templates/jquery/

3. Create your own settings.py

    1) Make a Copy settings.py.sample

        snoek/$ cp settings.py.sample .

    2) To edit settings.py for your own testing environment, usually you only
    need to modify the MEDIA_URL value:

       MEDIA_URL = 'http://localhost'

    make it point to your static server's root URL. This makes the css, image,
    jquery canbe imported to Snoek.

4. Create your own database

    It is fairly simple to start a new empty database in snoek:

        snoek/$ python manage.py syncdb

    * Notice: you will be asked to set a super user's password of the
      database.

    Meanwhile we also provide a sample database with test data populated for
    your experiments, to make use of it, simple make a copy:

        snoek/$ cp db.sqlite.sample db.sqlite

5. Run testing server

   snoek/$ python manage.py runserver localhost:8080

6. Test if it runs

    1) Open you browser and visit the url:

        http://localhost:8080/admin

        Login with the super user you set in the Step 4 and try to create
        several users in the adminitration pages.

    2) Open you browser and visit the url:

        http://localhost:8080

        Normally you can play with Snoek now!

6. The typical command of push your code to repo is:

   - You did some nice work of code improvement

   - snoek/$ git commit -a -m 'your tips goes here'

   - snoek/$ git pull -r

   - snoek/$ git push

7. If you are interested but do not have a ssh permission, please send a
patch to any of the contacts via:

    [quote from libreoffice community]
    * create the patch file that you want to mail.  If you are in one
    repository you can use git directly to get e.g. the last change in your
    branch as a diff file with:

           git format-patch HEAD~1


8. Library specific:
   
    Use celery to receive book information from internet
    requires:
       celery == 2.5.3
       django-celery == 2.5.5
       kumbo == 2.1.8

    suggest using pip install them

    1.start celery
            python manage.py celeryd
            
    2.start django
            python manage.py runserver
