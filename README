1. You need dependencies to run Snoek:
   - python 2.6 +
   
   - Django site pack for python

   - odfpy site pack for python

   You could also download Django and odfpy in the dependency directory of

   http://147.2.207.135/snoekv08.tar.bz2

2. You probably do not want to patch settings.py and db.sqlite, this is the way to do it after 'git pull':

        snoek/$ git update-index -assume-unchanged settings.py

        snoek/$ git update-index -assume-unchanged db.sqlite
   
   In case you meet a problem the upstream changes these 2 files, the reversing operation is:

        snoek/$ git update-index -no-assume-unchanged settings.py

        snoek/$ git update-index -no-assume-unchanged db.sqlite

   So, yes the db.sqlite is changing frequently since people wrote it. So to avoid the manual 
   operation above, it is better to set your own db by change setting.py. Then let db.sqlite there alone.

   For example:

       snoek/$ cp db.sqlite db
       
       change DATABASE_NAME = '/home/qateam/snoek/db.sqlite' => DATABASE_NAME = '$YOUR_SNOEK_HOME/db' 

3. edit settings.py for your own testing environment (replace all PATH info to your own snoek location)

4. Run testing server

   snoek/$ python manage.py runserver localhost:8080
